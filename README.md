Hello there,

When you are creating a MERN application , you first need to create a react app in the client folder , then create a server folder and install all the useful tools such as express, mongoose, body-parser etc.

Well, to reduce your workload , you can just use -

# npx all_mern_dependencies app_name

This command will automatically create a folder structure for you with client and server folder , where the client folder has the react application and the server folder has express, mongoose, body-parser, cors.

Thanks for reading , I hope you will be successfull in making any application you want.
